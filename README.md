## Racing Game

Demonstrates a fully Object Oriented approach to a jQuery "racing game", in which players race accross the screen from left to right. Each player is mapped to a key on the keyboard -- to move a player simply press their individual key.

Constructors include: `Game`, `Track`, `Player` and `PlayerView`.

`Player` objects are fully configurable (with customizable `name`, `key`, and `color` attributes). There is no hard limit on the number of players.
